  "body": "### Welcome to QDF\r\nQuick Doc Filler belongs to the domain Â­specific languages (DSL), specialized in simplifying the office documents generation, eliminating tedious information handling. This concept arises due to the non efficient processes that need to be performed in most office environments which results in unnecessary time consumption. This platform enables the users to transform commonly performed time consuming tasks into highly productive procedures.\r\n\r\n[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/R45VS741fQQ/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R45VS741fQQ) \r\n\r\n###Motivation\r\nWe live in the 21st century, everything is moving towards instantaneous, efficiency-oriented processes. The office environment is evolving in this same manner, everything becomes easier to do. Yet, there are still certain aspects that remain static, and have not evolve at the same rate. For example, the HR department of an office is known for the slow and tedious work involving lots of paper work and file handling. Whenever a document is requested, the time expected for it to be ready is unknown because of all the tasks that are needed for a simple document. This is where the idea of Quick Doc Filler comes in, designed to improve document generation on an office environment with ease and efficiency.\r\n\r\n### What does it do?\r\nQDF is a python base useful tool that allows the user to generate a variety of documents with variable information. It uses a set of preestablished templates which it fills up with a person's information that is stored in a database. The user can also add, edit and delete members to and from a database. After a document is generated, the user can send it as an email or print it, all with the same tool.\r\n\r\n### User Guide\r\nTBP\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe QDF team are composed by 3 Computer Engineering students of the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus, Luis E Rivera, Luis A Suarez and Miguel Velez. The project was developed as part of the Programming Language course taught by PhD Wilson Rivera Gallego.  \r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nLuis E Rivera - luis.rivera118@upr.edu\r\nMiguel A Velez - miguel.velez9@upr.edu\r\nLuis A Suarez - luis.suarez4@upr.edu\r\nWilson Rivera - wilson.riveragallego@upr.edu\r\n",
